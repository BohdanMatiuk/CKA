15 Without changing its existing containers, an existing Pod needs to be integrated into Kubernetes’s built-in logging architecture(e.g. kubectl logs). Adding a streaming sidecar container is a good and common way to accomplish this requirement.

Add a busybox sidecar container to the existing Pod legacy-app. The new sidecar container has to run the following command: /bin/sh -c tail -n+1 -f /var/log/legac-appp.log

Use a volume mount named logs to make the file /var/log/legacy-app.log available to the sidecar container.

Don’t modify the existing container.
Don’t modify the path of the log file, both containers must access it at /var/log/legacy-app.log.
