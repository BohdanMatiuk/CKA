2 Set the node labelled with name=ek8s-node-1 as unavailable and reschedule all the pods running on it.

Answer:

  1. kubectl get nodes --show-labels |grep name=ek8s-node-1

  2. kubectl cordon NODE_NAME (to make the Node unavailable)

  3. kubectl get nodes (STATUS -- Ready,SchedulingDisabled)

  4. kubectl drain NODE_NAME
        (to reschedule all the pods running on it)
                            "..cannot delete DaemontSet-managed Pods.."

      5. kubectl drain NODE_NAME --ignore-daemonsets --force 
      (to reSchedule all the pods running on it -forcefully & -ignore daemonts)

      6. kubectl get nodes -o wide (to confirm)
